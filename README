NAME
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Simple - A simple interface to Excel data

SYNOPSIS
      my $xls = Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Simple->read('spreadsheet.xls');
      foreach my $sheet ($xls->sheets) {
         while ($sheet->has_data) {  
             my @data = $sheet->next_row;
         }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This provides an abstraction to the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel module for
    simple reading of values.

    You simply loop over the sheets, and fetch rows to arrays.

    For anything more complex, you probably want to use
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel directly.

METHODS
  read
      my $xls = Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Simple->read('spreadsheet.xls');

    This opens the spreadsheet specified for you. Returns undef if we cannot
    read the book.

  sheets
      @sheets = $xls->sheets;

    Each spreadsheet can contain one or more worksheets. This fetches them
    all back. You can then iterate over them, or jump straight to the one
    you wish to play with.

  has_data
      if ($sheet->has_data) { ... }

    This lets us know if there are more rows in this sheet that we haven't
    read yet. This allows us to differentiate between an empty row, and the
    end of the sheet.

  next_row
      my @data = $sheet->next_row;

    Fetch the next row of data back.
